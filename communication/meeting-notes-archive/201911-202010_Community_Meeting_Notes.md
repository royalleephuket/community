When we're done, this will be super useful for both new CI Signalers and anyone interested in navigating the CI tooling to find, report and eliminate non-deterministic test results.  Thank you [@Lauri Apple](https://kubernetes.slack.com/team/U011C07244F)!

    *   [https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/09/03/warnings/](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/09/03/warnings/)
    *   It's hard to keep up with kubernetes
    *   Release notes are long
    *   Start with a manifest file -- example v1beta1/RBAC api file
        *   Is that deprecated yet?
        *   When is it going away?
    *   Added ability of the server to return warnings to users as of 1.19
    *   Server sends back headers to the clients (update your client)
    *   This works for any kubectl command
    *   In 1.19, you'll get warnings about all deprecated APIs
    *   In the future, we'll give warnings about other things
        *   Even problematic configurations, like 4millibytes of memory
    *   Also: metrics about upgradability of cluster.  Like, are people actually *using* the things that are deprecated?
        *   Check # of calls to deprecated API
    *   output is to STDERR.
    *   Kubectl does not have an option to silence warnings, but client-go does.

    *   ** Shoutouts this month (Check in #shoutouts on slack) **

**[Paris](https://app.slack.com/team/U5SB22BBQ)**: Shoutouts to our brand new upstream marketing team as part of [#sig-contribex](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C1TU9EB9S) working hard to make sure contributors are in the know. You can reach them if you need something amplified through a github issue template on Kubernetes/community or @contributor-comms tag in the #Sig-contribex channel. Thank you to our volunteers for building this!

**[Zacharysarah](https://app.slack.com/team/U5WQMKJEA)**: Shoutout to everyone who contributes to the [kubectl cheat sheet](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkubernetes.io%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fkubectl%2Fcheatsheet%2F). It's consistently the website's most-visited page, and it helps people a lot.

**[Lauri Apple](https://app.slack.com/team/U011C07244F)**: Want to call out [@Divya](https://kubernetes.slack.com/team/UV4J7K97Z) here for her extreme resilience—despite facing electricity issues around Cyclone Nisgara she still showed up for a release team prioritisation session yesterday and added so much value to the team's efforts to simplify release cycle processes. I shared this with my day-job colleagues, they were super-impressed.

**[Bentheelder](https://app.slack.com/team/U1P7T516X)**: shoutout to everyone involved in the [kubernetes.io](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkubernetes.io) announcement

I want to call out [@karenb](https://kubernetes.slack.com/team/UCLQ9GKSP) dealing with the aftermath of a tricky parser upgrade for the website, and helping enable the transition to a new Docsy theme. 

**[Neolit123](https://app.slack.com/team/U83J4CS3S)**: shout out to [@nicksantos](https://kubernetes.slack.com/team/UBJETRVFY) from Tilt for writing a proposal for standardizing local cluster registries via SIG Cluster Lifecycle: [https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/pull/1757](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fkubernetes%2Fenhancements%2Fpull%2F1757). Nick coordinated with multiple parties, planned the specification and responded to reviewer comments.

**[Jdetiber](https://app.slack.com/team/U0UV07D8T)**: Huge shout out to [@Katie Gamanji](https://kubernetes.slack.com/team/UC6PGGXS4) and [@naadir](https://kubernetes.slack.com/team/U6RDFQAF5) for delivering an amazing Cluster API Webinar 

**[Paris](https://app.slack.com/team/U5SB22BBQ)**: shoutout to [@nikhita](https://kubernetes.slack.com/team/U2PQHGMLN) for being a dependable, amazing, empathetic contributor :kubernetes-heart-eyes: thank you for all that you do.

**[Justaugustus](https://app.slack.com/team/U0E0E78AK)**: Thanks again to [@Lauri Apple](https://kubernetes.slack.com/team/U011C07244F) for her tireless optimization efforts in SIG Release (and across the project, in general). Seeing a lot of stuff start to shake loose, that we haven't able to prioritize, and I'm really appreciative!

        *   **Jason DeTiberus**: Huge shoutout to @jayunit100 for getting the forward port and parallelization of the e2e tests for cluster-api-provider-aws across the finish line, especially for fixing all of the bugs I left him with my initial parallelization PoC . Also huge thanks to @T V KUTUMBA RAO SIDRALA @Bhargav Madduru for their work building out the test suite and their initial forward porting efforts.  Additional props to @naadir for his assistance with the forward porting efforts, reviews, and testing.
        *   **Vishakha Nihore**: Huge shoutout to @paris @mrbobbytables & @markyjackson for the constant support and help during my Outreachy Internship. Considering it was my first time working with one of the largest community, I had not imagined it would be so much awesome. I couldn't have imagined working with Kubernetes can be this much fun TBH. All the lgtm  labels I asked from @markyjackson and all the questions (most of them quite simple and absurd) I asked from @mrbobbytables and the constant help I have got from @paris is just priceless.
        *   **Marko Mudrinić**: HUGE shoutout to @jdetiber for helping me understand what is new in the cluster-api v1alpha2 and answering every single question I had! He helped us a lot to understand how things should be done and how to bootstrap the project!

    *   SIG Windows[Michael Michael / Patrick Lang / Deep Debroy] Confirmed 
        *   Big investments coming that needed to be stabilized
        *   Windows identity:
            *   Graduating active directory and kube managed service accounts from beta to stable
            *   runAsUserName also going from beta to stable. Will allow apps and workloads to run in k8s well
        *   Lifecycle management and deployment:
            *   Kubeadm support going to beta, Cluster API support initial experimental support landed for Azure
            *   Looking to fork WINS to work on functionality. Should allow run join workflows a bit cleanly
            *   These all should help things run a bit closer to how things run on Linux
            *   Hoping to graduate kubeadm soon if all goes well
            *   Also hoping to provide experimental support for the Azure provider
        *   Trends
            *   Working on CRI-ContainerD to provide a path to run containers on CRI-ContainerD over Docker
            *   The key work that's needed to run containers through CRI expected to release with ContainerD 1.4
            *   Looking forward to keep this consistent across Linux and Windows going forward.
            *   Working also on developing a CSI proxy, which should allow using the proxy to handle privilege limitations
            *   CSI proxy work is being done out of tree to enable the CSI migration initiative to move out
            *   For 1.18, looking at scaling issues:
                *   With horizontal pod autoscaling, there were some issues with stats coming back from Docker. Working on that so it works better with Prometheus and others
                *   CPU limit honoring has been adjusted so it runs better under load
            *   There's been a trend that Windows tests have been failing for a couple days. Working with SIG testing to remove the manual testing, still working on getting some automation finished. [📣CONTRIBUTOR ACTION] Please review the PRs linked in the slides. All help encouraged!
                *   [#85599](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/85599) [#76838](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/76838) [#77398](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/77398) [#77269](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/77269) [#81226](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81226) [#88248](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/88248) [#88249](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/88249) 
            *   [LogMonitor open-sourced by Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/windows-container-tools/tree/master/LogMonitor) - makes it easy to take logs coming from a few places and copy them to stdout to allow kubectl logs, FluentD and others to scrape the logs properly
                *   Demo at Kubecon ([deck](https://sched.co/UagU), [video](https://youtu.be/t_e8SSkpdxU?t=1471))
        *   Notables from 1.17:
            *   Introduced RuntimeClass scheduler. Should make things easier for Windows devs to define the aspects of the workload you're working on with the podspec ([doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/windows/user-guide-windows-containers/#simplifying-with-runtimeclass))
            *   Also added new labels for Windows nodes, allowing major, minor, and patch builds. Much more compatible with OS.
        *   Plans
            *   Continuing major investments: kubeadm and cluster API support.
            *   Investing in more storage options
            *   Compatibility at runtime level with Linux

    *   SIG Auth  [Mikedanese / Mo Khan] Confirmed 
        *   Last cycle
            *   Adopted a new subproject: secrets store CSI driver
            *   Donated by {???}, integrates with external secret stores. Alt to secrets volume.
            *   A lot of users wanted deeper integration with Vault and others. So new subproject!
            *   Also doing a lot of work around certs. Certs API has been in beta for a long time; hasn't made much progress, so working on migrating it to GA. Wrote a retroactive KEP to help get to GA, and using that to organize the GA path. Includes support for multiple signers now. (Needed to reimplement the CA to include multiple IDs, so designed support for multiple signers.) Migrating clients to enable dynamic rotation of certs.
            *   Better performance! There's a whole list of improvements on the slide. Interesting ones according to the presentation: Token caching improvements to make the node authorizer (critical) much faster. Also added monitoring around latency, cache performance, authenticator use. Also added to k8s scalability prow scalability limits for auth.
        *   Upcoming cycles
            *   Keep improving scalability of storage encryption. Identified some problems with architecture that they want to address.
            *   Continue work on Certs API GA work. Number of PRs open.
            *   PodSecurityPolicy is on the radar. It's a hodpodge of features, so discussing ways to better contain constraints. See proposal linked in slides. Still discussing.
            *   Working on new service token support out to GA
                *   There were some issues with legacy tokens and compatibility issues that they are addressing.
        *   How this affects you
            *   Better performance. Better security.
            *   [CONTRIBUTOR ACTION] If any of this breaks things for anyone, please let the SIG know!
        *   [CONTRIBUTOR ACTION] Feel free to join the meetings! File bugs! Help improve monitoring! There's a lovely list of first-issue needs open. Also, if you use any of the clients, please take a look at those issues and help contribute. The SIG would love help and would love to hear from you.

For example when “v1.17.1” is tagged and released we also mark the branch with a tag “v1.17.2-beta.0".    The bugs root cause goes back many years in the design and implementation of the “anago” tool used to build and release, but are partially corrected now.  A complete fix likely will come first at the point we replace the “anago” tool.
