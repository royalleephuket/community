    *   tpepper:
        *   shoutout to @nikhita for a PR description and commit messages in https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82410 which makes a potentially daunting code review MUCH easier, and to @liggitt for similarly making the cherry-pick review MUCH easier with a stellar PR description text.  Super time saving when there‚Äôs a diffstat of ‚Äú+2,537 ‚àí59‚Äù but the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù text focuses the reviewer in on two key lines of code and the associated bugs tracking the problem report.

*   [ 0:01 ]**  Demo **-- [Octant](https://github.com/vmware/octant): A web-based, highly extensible platform for developers to better understand the complexity of Kubernetes cluster [Bryan Liles, @bryanl; Wayne Witzel, @wwitzel3]
    *   Web-based, but runs local, using your credentials (simplifies security)
    *   Demo application troubleshooting via the Octant UI
        *   Web app working
        *   Kubectl apply updated app
        *   Web app no longer working
        *   Use Octact to determine the cause
    *   Introduces the concept of ‚ÄúApplication‚Äù which is a set of consistent labels ‚Äúapp.kubernetes.io/name:httpbin‚Äù
    *   Visualization of dependency graph between Kubernetes resources. Detects that the Ingress is pointing to an invalid backend
    *   Drill down into service via the visualization graph and we notice that are no endpoints.
    *   Determine that it‚Äôs a bad selector and update and check that the graph is green again.
    *   If you‚Äôre on a Mac you can install via `brew install octant`

    *   Overview
        *   A kubernetes operator that automates promotion of canary deployments in order to route traffic
        *   Goal is to make deployments observable (plugins for slack, pagerduty, etc.)
        *   Workflow is driven using git (leveraging reviews before applying changes to infrastructure for example)
        *   Grafana dashboard and alerting is included
        *   Gracefully promotes or rolls back deployments based on configurable success rates
        *   Also supports A/B testing, based on specific HTTP headers or cookies
    *   Questions
        *   Is the plan to offer this to the K8s community, CNCF, or some other upstream location?
            *   open source project under weaveworks
            *   plan to submit to CNCF sandbox at some point

        *   timothysc - might want to poke @neolit123 on reviews, b/c he's done so much test infra this last cycle he deserves some sort of metal.

    *   jimangel: Shoutout to @m2 (Michael Michael) and @craiglpeters for writing a massive amount of Windows documentation needed for the v1.14 release! Also, thanks for involving the #sig-docs crew very early in the process! Please tag anyone I missed.
    *   tpepper (Tim Pepper): Shoutouts to @spiffxp and @maria (Maria Ntalla) and @jberkus (Josh Berkus) for work across recent months toward a simplified/cleaner https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-release-master-blocking config.  And to all the SIGs who‚Äôve responded with improvements to known flaky test cases.  It is hard to state the importance of stable/green CI‚Ä¶. :green_heart: :testgrid:
    *   zacharysarah: Shout to @rui for replacing a ton of absolute links in the docs with relative paths. A ton of work for largely invisible results that make localizations easier.
    *   spiffxp: Shout to @nikhita (Nikhita Raghunath) for making sigs.yaml (and the generator app) the grand unified theory of kubernetes community, representing SIGs, WGs, and now thanks to her efforts, User Groups and Committees.  Organizational stuff can be boring but it‚Äôs important, so really great stuff to offload to machines!
