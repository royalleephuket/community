## What I have done

A large part of what I‚Äôve done has been driving the effort to build/maintain a
healthy contributor community.  I‚Äôve tried to make it easier for new contributors,
worked towards ensuring active reviewer/approvers, streamlined the issue triage
process and more. A few notable items:

- [Routinely pruned and update OWNERS files](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kubernetes-dev/4160VsBL7OI/BsBRZSqpCQAJ)
- [Defined policy around inactive members](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kubernetes-dev/AvCa-sGx9Jw/zByeyP9LAgAJ)
- [Helped run several of our Contributor Summits](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/events) (in the before times üò≠)
- Trusted member of the [GitHub Admin Team](https://git.k8s.io/community/github-management#github-administration-team) and a representative to GitHub for the project
- [Moderator of all the things](https://git.k8s.io/community/communication/moderators.md)
- Driven further automation and improvements in the KEP process.
- Surface our docs and resources in a more accessible fashion aka contributor site \o/ - [https://k8s.dev](https://k8s.dev)

Beyond Kubernetes, I‚Äôve been involved heavily with the CNCF, as an[ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/),
co-chair of the [Research User Group](https://github.com/cncf/research-user-group),
and I‚Äôve had a close working relationship with them through the Contributor Summits.

## What I‚Äôll do

(aka My Pitch)

I‚Äôve been an end user and part time contributor for the majority of my time in the project.. I‚Äôve
experienced the frustrations of participating and I‚Äôve driven hard to improve them. If elected, I‚Äôd
focus on shoring up the areas of the project that are under-represented or under-staffed. I want to
build sustainable models to grow our contributors - our reviewers, approvers, owners and future
leaders.

## Endorsements

‚Äú[Let's be clear, I am incredibly biased. But I also don't think there's anyone else I'd rather see elected to steering.](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/kubernetes-dev/0Eqc07-PNdc/I61aarXDBwAJ)‚Äù - @jeefy
