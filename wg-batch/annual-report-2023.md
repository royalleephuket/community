  - Promoted to beta [Backoff Limits Per Index For Indexed Jobs](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-apps/3850-backoff-limits-per-index-for-indexed-jobs).
  - Introduced as beta [Elastic Indexed Job](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-apps/3715-elastic-indexed-job).
  - Create [JobSet API for managing a group of k8s Jobs](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset) and release [3 major versions in 2023](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/jobset/releases).
  - [Kueue project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/releases) released [3 major versions in 2023](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/releases).

  We've also switched our meetings schedule to attract broader set of contributors
  from all around the globe.
