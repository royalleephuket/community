2. Are there any areas and/or subprojects that your group needs help with (e.g. fewer than 2 active OWNERS)?


    - Mentoring subproject needs a dedicated leadership, responsible for running both (i) group mentoring cohorts for Kubernetes SIGs & WGs, (ii) external mentoring programs (LFX Mentorship, Google Summer of Code, Google Summer of Docs, Outreachy, etc)


    - Elections subproject is in need of a lead (someone preferably with Python programming experience), who will own & maintain the [election software](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/elections#software), pick [election officers](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/tree/master/elections#recommending-election-officers), and  help groups in the Kubernetes project who wants to use the election software.
